# Comprehensive Technical Documentation for Game Time Monitoring System with Telegram Integration  

## System Overview and Key Features  

The Game Time Monitoring System is a Python-based solution designed to track user gaming activity through process monitoring and provide real-time notifications and statistics via a Telegram bot. This system combines low-level system operations with modern messaging API integration, offering a robust tool for personal productivity monitoring or parental control applications. Key innovations include multi-threaded architecture for concurrent monitoring and bot operations, intelligent process detection using system-level APIs, and interactive reporting through an intuitive Telegram interface.  

### Core Functionality  
1. Real-time Process Monitoring: Scans active processes every 5 seconds to detect gaming applications  
2. Telegram Bot Integration: Provides instant notifications and on-demand statistics through chat commands  
3. Session Time Calculation: Tracks both active and historical gaming sessions with millisecond precision  
4. Multi-Threaded Architecture: Ensures smooth operation of monitoring and bot components simultaneously  
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems  

## Architectural Design  

### Component Interaction Diagram  

The system employs a producer-consumer pattern with three primary components:  

1. Process Monitor Engine  
- Responsibility: Continuous scanning of system processes  
- Technology: psutil library for cross-platform process enumeration  
- Output: Detection events (process start/stop)  
- Thread Type: Daemon thread with 5-second polling interval  

2. Data Management Layer  
- Data Structures:  
  - start_times: Dictionary {process_name: datetime}  
  - total_play_time: Dictionary {process_name: seconds}  
- Concurrency Control: threading.Lock() ensures atomic updates  
- Data Persistence: In-memory storage with periodic saving capability (future enhancement)  

3. Telegram Bot Interface  
- Command Processing:  
    @bot.message_handler(commands=['status'])
  def send_status(message):
      # Implementation details
  
- Notification Subsystem: Async message delivery with retry logic  
- Security: Token-based authentication via environment variables  

### Concurrency Model  

The system implements a hybrid threading model:  

| Component         | Thread Type | Priority | Execution Characteristics          |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Process Monitor   | Daemon      | High     | CPU-intensive short bursts          |
| Telegram Bot      | Daemon      | Medium   | I/O-bound with idle periods         |
| Main Controller   | Primary     | Low      | User input handling                 |

The threading.Lock() mechanism prevents race conditions during dictionary updates:  
with data_lock:
    if pname not in start_times:
        start_times[pname] = datetime.now()

## Technical Specifications  

### Dependency Matrix  

| Package           | Version | Purpose                          | Criticality |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| psutil            | 5.9.0   | Process monitoring               | High        |
| pyTelegramBotAPI  | 4.12.0  | Telegram integration             | High        |

| threading         | Built-in| Concurrency control              | Critical    |

### Process Detection Algorithm  

def check_games():
    current_games = set()
    for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name']):
        try:
            pname = proc.info['name']
            if pname in game_process_names:
                current_games.add(pname)
                # Detection logic
        except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied, psutil.ZombieProcess):
            continue
    # Session calculation logic

Key characteristics:  
- O(n) Complexity: Linear scan of active processes  
- Case-Sensitive Matching: Requires exact process name matches  
- Exception Handling: Robust error recovery for transient processes

## Security Considerations  

### Attack Surface Analysis  

1. Telegram API Exposure  
- Risk: Unauthorized command execution  
- Mitigation: Environment variable storage of BOT_TOKEN  
- Protection: Telegram's built-in authorization system  

2. Process Enumeration  
- Risk: Potential privilege escalation  
- Mitigation: Principle of least privilege execution  
- Protection: Regular security updates for psutil  

3. Data Storage  
- Risk: Memory-resident sensitive data  
- Mitigation: Encryption-at-rest for future persistent storage  

### Security Best Practices  

# Secure token handling example
load_dotenv()  # Load from file, not environment
BOT_TOKEN = os.getenv('BOT_TOKEN')  # Never hardcode
bot = telebot.TeleBot(BOT_TOKEN)  # Proper initialization

## Extension and Customization  

### Adding New Features  

1. Web Dashboard Integration  
# Flask integration example
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/stats')
def web_stats():
    with data_lock:
        return jsonify(total_play_time)

—Å–ª–∞–≤–∞, [06.06.2025 1:48]
2. Cloud Synchronization  
# AWS S3 backup example
import boto3
def backup_stats():
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket='game-stats',
        Key='playtime.json',
        Body=json.dumps(total_play_time)
    )

3. Advanced Reporting  
# Matplotlib visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def generate_pie_chart():
    labels = list(total_play_time.keys())
    sizes = list(total_play_time.values())
    plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
    plt.savefig('playtime_distribution.png')

## Troubleshooting Guide  

### Common Issues and Solutions  

Issue 1: Bot Not Responding  
- Check firewall settings for Telegram API access (api.telegram.org:443)  
- Verify BOT_TOKEN matches @BotFather's configuration  
- Ensure correct CHAT_ID format (numeric value without quotes)  

Issue 2: Undetected Games  
- Confirm exact process name via Task Manager/psutil  
- Run application as administrator for privileged access  
- Add exception to antivirus real-time scanning  

Issue 3: High CPU Usage  
- Increase monitoring interval from 5s to 10s  
- Exclude non-critical processes from monitoring list  
- Consider process priority adjustments
